//APIController.cs Code Breakdown:

The code above creates an API endpoint using the ASP.NET Core framework. 
The APIController class is a controller that is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests to the API.

The RestAPIDbContext class is a database context class that is used to access the ApiData table in the database.

The HttpGet attribute specifies that the GetApiData method should handle HTTP GET requests. 
The Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<ApiData>>> return type specifies that the method should return a list of ApiData objects wrapped in an ActionResult object.

The GetApiData method returns a list of all ApiData objects from the database by calling the ToListAsync() method on the _context.ApiData object. 
The async and await keywords are used to ensure that the method executes asynchronously and doesn't block the thread.

Overall, this code creates an API endpoint that returns a list of ApiData objects from the database when a GET request is made to the /API endpoint.
